## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* fixed the content of `LICENSE`
* wrapped `nint` in `DESCRIPTION` in single quotes as recommended
* renamed S3 class `design` to `desigh`, to avoid name conflicts with `graphics::plot.design`

## Test environments

* local Linux Mint install, R 3.1.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs.

## Downstream dependencies

There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.
