Description: docopulae offers a set of functions to define parametric models by their joint density (likelihood), evaluate the Fisher information, find D- and Ds-optimal designs and eventually compute common statistics. A crucial aspect is modularity, so the user may replace any function by a specialized solution. The package also consists of a number of convenience functions for general purpose and specific to the task.
