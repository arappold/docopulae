#' Design of Experiments with Copulas
#'
#' docopulae provides a set of functions to define parametric models by their joint densities (likelihood), evaluate the Fisher information, find D- and Ds-optimal designs and eventually compute common statistics. A crucial aspect is modularity. At any point the user may employ specialized solutions. The package also consists of a number of convenience functions, some general purpose, some specific to the task.
